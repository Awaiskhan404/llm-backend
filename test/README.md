In software development, testing plays a critical role in ensuring the quality and reliability of a codebase. Unit testing and integration testing are two fundamental approaches used to validate software components and their interactions. Organizing test files and test targets in a structured manner is essential for maintaining a clear and maintainable testing suite.

1. **Unit Testing:**
   Unit tests focus on verifying the correctness of individual units or components of code in isolation. A unit can be a function, method, or class that performs a specific task within the codebase. These tests ensure that each unit behaves as expected, identifying bugs early in the development process and allowing developers to refactor with confidence.

   For the purpose of organization, in this template (and in `Go` projects in general) unit tests are typically placed in the same folder as the corresponding test target. This makes it easier to locate and manage the tests for a particular unit.

   Example file tree for a Go project:

   ```
   project/
   └── internal/
       ├── module_a.go
       ├── module_a_test.go     # Unit test for module_a.go
       ├── module_b.go
       └── module_b_test.go     # Unit test for module_b.go
   ```

2. **Integration Testing:**
   Integration tests, on the other hand, are designed to validate the interactions between multiple units or packages, ensuring that they work seamlessly together as a whole. Unlike unit tests that focus on isolated functionality, integration tests mimic real-world scenarios and check for the integration points' correctness.

   Since integration tests span throughout multiple packages and are not specific to a single file, they are often organized separately in a designated folder. This promotes a clear separation between unit and integration tests, making it easier to distinguish between different test types.

   Example file tree for a Go project:

   ```
   project/
   ├── internal/
   │   ├── module_a.go
   │   ├── module_a_test.go     # Unit test module_a.go
   │   ├── module_b.go
   │   └── module_b_test.go     # Unit test module_b.go
   └── test/
       └── integration_test.go  # Integration test for module_a.go & module_b.go
   ```

By adhering to this organized approach, development teams can maintain a well-structured and easily navigable testing suite. This helps to improve code quality, enhance collaboration among team members, and facilitate faster and more efficient bug identification and resolution. Additionally, having clear separation between unit and integration tests allows developers to run them selectively based on their needs and testing objectives.
