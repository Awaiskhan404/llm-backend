## Project Overview üìã
`alexmodrono/gin-restapi-template` is a comprehensive and well-structured starting point for developing RESTful APIs using the Gin framework. This template aims to streamline the initial setup and provide a foundation for building robust and scalable APIs with a clean architecture.

The main key features include, but are not limited to:

- ü´ß**Clean Architecture**: The template embraces a modular and organized structure based on the principles of Clean Architecture. It leverages the power of `go-fx` for robust dependency injection, enhancing maintainability, scalability, and code reusability.

- üß≠**Efficient Routing**: Utilizing the powerful routing capabilities of Gin, the template enables easy management of API endpoints, middleware, and request handling.

- üë∑**Middleware Integration**: Built-in support for middleware such as authentication, logging, CORS, and more, allowing you to enhance your API's functionality and security with ease.

- ‚ùóÔ∏è**Error Handling**: The template includes a comprehensive error handling mechanism, ensuring consistent and informative error responses for better client interaction and debugging.

- üíæ**Database Integration**: By leveraging the `pgx` driver, the template enables direct communication with PostgreSQL databases without the additional overhead and abstraction provided by an ORM. This approach provides more control and fine-grained optimization opportunities, allowing you to tailor the database interactions to the specific needs of your application.

- üö¶**Request Validation**: Implement request validation and data binding effortlessly by binding to DTOs, ensuring data integrity and security.

- üß™**Testing Support**: The template encourages writing tests by providing a test-friendly structure, making it easier to verify the functionality and stability of your API.

Because of all the aforementioned reasons, by using this template you can expedite the development process of your next project as it allows you to focus on building your specific business logic while leveraging the proven architecture, routing, middleware, and other essential components provided.

Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting with `Gin`, this template provides a solid foundation and best practices for creating clean, scalable, and production-ready REST APIs.

## Motivation üí™
Finding the perfect REST API template for `golang` and `Gin` can be a daunting task, as the existing options may not always fulfill all the specific requirements of your project. While several popular templates like [`dipeshdulal/clean-gin`](https://github.com/dipeshdulal/clean-gin/) and [`vsouza/go-gin-boilerplate`](https://github.com/vsouza/go-gin-boilerplate) have garnered attention, they might lack certain essential features you need to have a full-fledged REST API.

To address these limitations and create a more tailored solution, I decided to develop my own API template. This template not only solves many of the problems developers may find when starting their new project, but also incorporates several crucial functionalities for a clean and efficient API development process.

And one of the key features of the template is the implementation of dependency injection through `go.uber.org/fx`, which promotes better code organization and modularity. By using this approach, the API becomes more maintainable and easier to extend over time. This template also aims to teach how to use `go-fx` in complex codebases and even provides examples for how to do tests, which is something I struggled to find on the internet when developing this project.

Furthermore, this template intentionally avoids using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to interact with databases. Instead, it uses `github.com/jackc/pgx`, a low-level, high performance interface that exposes PostgreSQL-specific features to Go. This way, it allows developers to utilize the full potential of native SQL queries, and it should be fairly easy to change the driver with one for your preferred database.

Additionally, the template includes built-in support for validating both `json` and `form url-encoded` request bodies. By incorporating this validation mechanism, developers can ensure that incoming data is accurately validated and processed, leading to enhanced data integrity and security.

To ensure a consistent and well-organized project structure, this template adheres to the standard golang folder structure. This practice not only improves the readability of the codebase but also enables other developers to quickly grasp the project's layout.

In terms of error handling, the template focuses on user-friendly messages and informative responses. By providing clear and meaningful error messages, the API users can easily understand and troubleshoot any issues they might encounter, thereby enhancing the overall user experience.

Additionally, as I further iterated on the template, I incorporated more features that cater to various use cases and requirements, such as CORS, logging, user authentication and authorization, custom SQL query functions, among others.

In conclusion, this custom REST API template for `golang` and `Gin` is designed to encompass a comprehensive set of features while maintaining simplicity and flexibility. By combining dependency injection, absence of ORM, data validation, standardized folder structure, user-friendly error handling, and various other functionalities, this template serves as a solid foundation for developing clean, efficient, and tailored APIs to suit your specific needs.
